## üßê About

Next Power Starter is an **optionated** Next.js starter template with flexibility & ease of use in mind.

I always find myself needing to setup the project in the same way, and often times, reusing the same structures and types. Hence, I've put together the common configurations into this starter template.

PS: It uses Next.js 13's [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

## ‚ö° Features

Next Power Starter includes the following features out-of-the-box:

- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/): A React UI library which supports _almost_ all components you can think of. It also provides dark-mode support and utility hooks that I often find handy.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Mantine sometimes lacks the granularity in designing the styles. Tailwind comes naturally as the optimal choice to fill in the gap.

- [useQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/): No more üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `fetching` in `useEffect`. Also provides caching and various other powerful features like refetch, loading state, etc.

- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand): A small but powerful state management library so that we don't need to be bothered about Redux anymore.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): This project is fully typed.

## üõ† Getting Started

1. You can either clone this repo, or run the following command to use the template

   ```bash
   yarn create-next-app [project-name] -e https://github.com/HohShenYien/next-power-starter
   # or
   npx create-next-app [project-name] -e https://github.com/HohShenYien/next-power-starter
   ```

   Alternatively, you can click `Use this template` button from GitHub.

2. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Usage

### Modal

#### Vanilla Modal

To use Mantine's modal, there are two choices here. You can either use [vanilla modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) with the standard `onClose` and `open` disclosures.

#### Modal Manager

Alternatively, you can use [Modal Manager](https://mantine.dev/others/modals/) implemented with a global context manager that is much simpler. To open a modal, you can simply call

```ts
openModal({
  type: "<Modal Name>",
  innerProps: {
    // props go here
  },
});
```

This template has implemented a **helper** for modal manager. To use it, you'll have to add the modal into `/src/utils/modals/types.ts`

```ts
// This is the modal names, constants to identify the modal
export const helloWorldModal = "Hello World Modal";
export const secondModal = "Second Modal";

// Add the modal here for TypeScript support
export type ModalType = typeof helloWorldModal | typeof secondModal;

// Still figuring out how to work without using this type
export type ModalInnerProps = {
  // The modal type to the props type
  [key in typeof helloWorldModal]: HelloWorldModalProps;
} & {
  [key in typeof secondModal]: {};
};
//...
```

### Zustand Store

While using Zustand's `persist` middleware, there'll be [hydration mismatch](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/issues/1145), that is, server-side rendered contents do not match client side contents. This happens because `localStorage` can only be retrieved on the frontend.

A temporary solution here is using `useStore` hook from here, where the values are only retrieved after client renders.

```ts
const { bears, increase } = useStore(
  useBearStore,
  (state) => state
) ?? // The defaults are set here as they will be empty before client renders
{
  bears: 0,
  increase: () => null,
};
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out Vercel's [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
